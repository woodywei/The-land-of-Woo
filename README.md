# The-land-of-Woo

AKA Woody's retirement plan

I'm think about a game, it will have several parts.
1. Selfie to statics
Like any rpg games, user will have inital statics about strenth, agile, wisdom, and special movement if you want to show more about yourself.
2. Game generator
I want it to be an open world, sound like an amateur, but for example, dungeons and dragons from adventure book, we can extract the basic element and story, then you can twist or review it before let it out.
and the statics from selfie can be used at here as initials.
3. Open
The data can not be saved locally, and games in here can be wild and free.

(Damn, I wish someone can chip in)
